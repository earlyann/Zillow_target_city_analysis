The Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) is a metric used to measure the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It is available as a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure and as a raw measure. Zillow publishes top-tier ZHVI, which is the typical value for homes within the 65th to 95th percentile range for a given region, and bottom-tier ZHVI, which is the typical value for homes within the 5th to 35th percentile range for a given region. ZHVI is also published for all single-family residences, condos/co-ops, and for homes with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5+ bedrooms, as well as the ZHVI per square foot, which is the typical value of all homes per square foot calculated by taking the estimated home value for each home in a given region and dividing it by the homeâ€™s square footage. The data used in this analysis is for all homes (SFR, condos, and co-ops) smoothed and seasonally adjusted.

The relationships between home values, home list prices, and home sales prices can provide insight into the housing market and its current state. Home values refer to the estimated market value of a property, while home list prices refer to the initial asking price set by the homeowner or real estate agent when the property is listed for sale. Home sales prices refer to the final price that a buyer pays for the property after negotiations and other factors are taken into account. In general, home values and home list prices are positively correlated, but this correlation is not always perfect, and homes may sell for more or less than their initial list prices based on market conditions, demand, and other factors.

The correlation coefficients (r) for median home values in Minneapolis, Seattle, Portland, and Boulder by year 2000-2022 are 0.75, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.89, respectively. These values suggest a moderate to strong positive correlation between the years and the median home values in each of these cities. The highest correlation is seen in Portland, indicating a stronger relationship between time and home values in that city compared to the others. However, it's worth noting that a correlation coefficient alone does not necessarily imply causation, and other factors may be influencing these trends. Nonetheless, these values provide insight into how the median home values have changed over time in these cities and can help inform decisions related to real estate and investment.

Median home values for all target cities show each city following similar trends from 2011 onward. Prior to that, Seattle and Portland show a dramatic rise, peaking in 2007 during the subprime mortgage crisis, and following decline. Minneapolis was less affected by this but does show a peak and dip. Boulder's home prices held steady from 2002 until 2012, and since then, all home prices for all four cities started to rise.

Home inventory for target cities 2018-2022 shows a cyclical nature of inventory in all four cities. Minneapolis historically has had the most inventory, followed by Seattle and Portland. As of mid-2022, Seattle overtook Minneapolis. Boulder has far less inventory than the other three cities.

Median list price of target cities 2018-2022 shows Boulder being the most expensive, followed by Seattle and Portland, with Minneapolis home prices falling far below the others.

Median list price vs. sales price of target cities 2018-2022 shows a general trend in all four cities of sales prices falling below list prices but approaching even around 2021. Minneapolis and Seattle had a brief time in 2021 where sales prices topped list prices.
